### Hello there ðŸ‘‹
I am a bioinformatics student interested in data science and data analysis. My GitHub will host the results of my work. You can also find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martyna-szulc-5101ab221/).
Thank you for taking the time to look at my projects!

Have a nice day ðŸŒ·
